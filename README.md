# JAVA CASE STUDY CRIME ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SYSTEM(C.A.R.S)

This project is a comprehensive Crime Analysis and Reporting System (C.A.R.S.) designed to address the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in managing and reporting crime data. It emphasizes SQL schema design, control flow statements, loops, arrays, collections, exception handling, database interaction, and unit testing.

## Project Structure:

The project follows a structured directory layout as follows:

- **entity**: Contains entity classes representing real-world entities.
- **dao**: Contains interfaces and implementation classes for database interaction.
- **exception**: Contains user-defined exceptions and exception handling mechanisms.
- **util**: Contains utility classes for database connection management.
- **main**: Contains the main class to demonstrate application functionalities.
- **unit testing**: for testing the incident creation and incident update status.

## Key Functionalities:

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Schema Design**: Design the database schema with entities like Incidents, Victims, Suspects, Law Enforcement Agencies, Officers, Evidence, and Reports, along with their relationships.
2. **Service Provider Interface/Abstract Class**: Define interfaces/abstract classes with methods for CRUD operations and reporting functionalities.
3. **Database Connectivity**: Implement classes for establishing database connections and executing SQL queries.
4. **Service Implementation**: Develop service classes to implement the methods defined in the service provider interface/abstract class.
5. **Exception Handling**: Define custom exceptions and handle them appropriately throughout the application.
6. **Main Method**: Create a main class to demonstrate the application functionalities in a menu-driven format.
7. **Unit Testing**: Develop JUnit test cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.

## Schema Design:

The database schema includes entities such as Incidents, Victims, Suspects, Law Enforcement Agencies, Cases, Officers, Evidence, and Reports, with appropriate attributes and relationships.

## Implementation:

Follow the provided tasks and guidelines to implement the project functionalities in Java, focusing on object-oriented programming, database interaction, and exception handling.
